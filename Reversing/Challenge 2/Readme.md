## PYC File

##### A PYC (Python Compiled) file is a compiled version of a Python source file (.py). When you run a Python script, the interpreter compiles the source code into 
##### bytecode, which is a low-level representation of the code that is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). 
##### This compilation process helps improve the execution speed of the Python code.

##### Here's a overview of how it works:

##### 1.Source Code (.py): This is the human-readable Python code that you write.

##### 2.Bytecode (.pyc): When you run a Python script, the interpreter compiles the source code into bytecode. This bytecode is a set of instructions that the Python Virtual Machine can execute directly.

##### 3.Execution: The Python interpreter executes the bytecode using the Python Virtual Machine, which is a part of the Python runtime environment.

##### The PYC files are typically stored in the __pycache__ directory within the directory where the corresponding source files are located. 
##### These files have the same name as the source files but with a .pyc extension.
